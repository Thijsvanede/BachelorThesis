//TODO add variables staying within bounds \&\& own copies being equal to global variables.
A couple of theorems leading to invariants need to be proven to be certain Lace works correct.
The first theorem is that every task is stolen only once.
The second theorem is that every task is executed exactly once.
To prove both theorems, they need to be rewritten as invariants.
When every task is stolen only once, it means thieving threads can only steal tasks $\geq$ \texttt{tail} and that when tail reduces, a task cannot be stolen again.
This is written as an invariant in Figure \ref{inv:stolen}.
